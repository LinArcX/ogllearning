# ogllearning
An attempt to learn opengl with c++11 and modern techniques and design patterns.
To work with this repository you need at least one window manager library and one extension loader. I chose GLFW for the first one and GLAD for the socond one.

But you can also use SDL, GLEW or other options.

# Design patterns
1. State pattern
2. Singleton

# Prerequisites
- git
- gcc(clang)
- SDL2-devel
- GLFW
- GLEW
- GLAD

# Build/Run/Clean
```
chmod +x build.sh
source build.sh
```

Now you can use bash functions as operations.

Build the project: `build`

Run it: `run`

Clean the build directory: `clean`
